### Project Description
[This project is a university website homepage built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It displays announcements, navigation menus, and quick links, but includes a playful twist ‚Äî clicking any link triggers a custom 504 Gateway Timeout error page instead of navigating away]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[This project solves the completely imaginary problem of people navigating away from your beautiful homepage before truly appreciating it. By showing a fake 504 error on every click, it ensures visitors stay right where you want them‚Äîtrapped in your masterpiece forever.?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We ‚Äúsolved‚Äù this non-problem by adding a sneaky JavaScript trap that blocks all links and instantly replaces the site with a dramatic, cinematic 504 Gateway Timeout page. No servers were harmed, but countless unsuspecting clicks will now be stopped in their tracks‚Äîbecause leaving is not an option.]
